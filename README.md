# Deliverboy - A Seamless clone.

Built with Node & Express, Passport for User Auth, MongoDB as the DB, Stripe as the credit card processor.

In progress.

1. Npm install to get dependecies
2. Npm install Stripe & dotenv
3. Create a .env file in the root directory, add the stripe secret key
4. update the public key in main.js

Issues:

Errors happening with Stripe payments - there's some sort of problem with the way it's currently organized and accessing main.js. Possible solution: move views in public.
